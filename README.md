## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Observations
- **Hours_Studied** and **Attendance** show strong positive correlation with `Exam_Score`.
- **Sleep_Hours** and **Physical_Activity** are normally distributed.
- **Most common categories:**  
  - `Gender`: Male students dominate the dataset.  
  - `Parental Education`: High School most frequent.  
  - `Learning Disabilities`: Mostly "No".  
- **No severe skewness** (all features have skewness values within ¬±0.5).

### Visualization Highlights
- **Univariate:** Count plots for categorical features, histograms, boxplots, and KDE plots for numeric features.  
- **Bivariate:** Scatter plots (e.g., Hours_Studied vs Exam_Score), line plots, and bar plots reveal positive relationships.  
- **Multivariate:**  
  - Correlation heatmap shows `Hours_Studied` and `Attendance` as key predictors.  
  - Pairplots illustrate strong linear trends.

## üìà Model Performance Comparison

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R¬≤ Score |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| **Random Forest Regressor** | 0.874 | 1.092 | 0.873 |
| **Linear Regression** | 0.913 | 1.117 | 0.867 |
| **KNN Regressor** | 1.707 | 2.176 | 0.496 |
| **Decision Tree Regressor** | 1.982 | 2.457 | 0.358 |

## üß† Interpretation

- **Top Predictors:** `Hours_Studied`, `Attendance`, and `Previous_Scores` strongly influence `Exam_Score`.  
- **Model Insights:**  
  - Random Forest performed best overall.  
  - Linear Regression gave near-similar accuracy, indicating linear relationships in data.  
  - KNN and Decision Tree models underperformed, suggesting overfitting or insufficient complexity capture.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Best R¬≤ Score:** 0.873  
- **Best RMSE:** 1.09  
- **Key Takeaway:**  
  Student performance is most affected by **study time**, **attendance**, and **previous academic record**. Random Forest provides the most reliable exam score predictions.
